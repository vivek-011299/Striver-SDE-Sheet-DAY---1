/*
*
Given two sorted arrays arr1[] and arr2[] of sizes n and m in non-decreasing order. Merge them in sorted order without using any extra space. Modify arr1 so that it contains the first N elements and modify arr2 so that it contains the last M elements.

 Solution :-
 
 void merge(long long arr1[], long long arr2[], int n, int m) 
        { 
            int i=n-1;
            int j=0;
            while(i>-1 && j<m && arr1[i]>arr2[j])                         //Swap till element in first array is greater than elements in second array.
            {
                swap(arr1[i],arr2[j]);
                i--;j++;
            }
            sort(arr1,arr1+n);
            sort(arr2,arr2+m);
        }
